        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These falafels are the closest thing to NYC street vendor falafels! Made the traditional way with dried soaked chickpeas! Great on a pita with lettuce, cucumber and yogurt. Asafoetida is usually found in Middle Eastern or Indian food stores. If you prefer, you can use 2 to 3 garlic cloves and 1 small chopped onion instead. This is a great base recipe, customize it to your own tastes.</p>
