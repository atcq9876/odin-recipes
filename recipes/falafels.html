        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p class="description"><strong>These falafels are the closest thing to NYC street vendor falafels!</strong> Made the traditional way with dried soaked chickpeas! Great on a pita with lettuce, cucumber and yogurt. Asafoetida is usually found in Middle Eastern or Indian food stores. If you prefer, you can use 2 to 3 garlic cloves and 1 small chopped onion instead. This is a great base recipe, customize it to your own tastes.</p>
